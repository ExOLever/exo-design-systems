# Voice and tone

**Voice** reflects our personality. It’s **_what_ we say.** Our voice is:
* Friendly
* Respectful
* Enthusiastic
* Straighforward

**Tone** is the way we speak. It’s **_how_ we say things.** Our tone is about:
* Clarity over entertainment
* Educate w/o being patronizing
* Casual w/o being too informal
